# Image Filtering using 2D-convolution
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Convolution of two functions is one of the most important processes used in signal processing. In areas such as computer graphics and image processing, due to the discrete nature of functions (such as images), we deal with the discrete form of convolution. Among the applications of convolution in these fields, we can mention removing noise and extracting visual features for deep learning (artificial intelligence). Some of these applications have been implemented in this project.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the filters that are implemented in this project:
- Sharpness filter (valid/stride = 1)
- Horizontal edge filter (same/stride = 2)
- Embossing filter (valid/stride = 3)
- Gaissian filter (same/stride = 1)
